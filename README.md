# My Projects

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository, where I explore and share projects across various programming languages and technologies. This repository serves as a showcase of my learning journey and experimentation.

## Overview

This repository is organized by programming language and technology, making it easy to navigate through different areas of my work. Below is a brief description of each main directory:

- [`BrainFuck`](/BrainFuck): This directory contains projects and experiments written in the Brainfuck programming language, known for its minimalistic design. Also here I have `BrainFuck Interpreteter writted on 'C lang'`.
- [`WhiteSpace`](/WhiteSpace): In this directory, I delve into the WhiteSpace programming language, working with its unique, whitespace-based syntax.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring my projects, simply clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanyilT/my_projects.git
